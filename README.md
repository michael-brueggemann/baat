You can simply use axe-core or create your custom rulesets based on axe-core.
## Features

4. Get a version of axe.min.js.

   The axe.min.js file contains the rule definitions. It needs to be selected in the BAAT interface to enable the bookmarklet to run the tests.

2. Head to the [BAAT GitHub releases page](https://github.com/mindscreen/baat/releases/latest).
3. Download the userscript.js file.
4. Install the Userscript using your userscript manager.
5. Get a version of axe.min.js.

   The axe.min.js file contains the rule definitions. It needs to be selected in the BAAT interface to enable the bookmarklet to run the tests.

### Options

#### Issue Impact Filters

The Issue Impact filters control which issues are shown in the results. The default is to show only serious or critical issues.

The developer mode is an advanced mode of BAAT. 
It will display the results of the axe-core test in a more detailed way. 
This is useful for developers who want to see the exact error messages.

## Troubleshooting
### Content Security Policies (CSP)
Some websites use Content Security Policies (CSP) to restrict the execution of third-party scripts. If a website has a CSP that blocks the execution of third-party scripts, BAAT may not work as expected.

If you encounter issues with BAAT not running on a website, it's possible that the website has a CSP that blocks the execution of third-party scripts. In this case, you may need to contact the website administrator to request that they whitelist BAAT in their CSP.

## Building BAAT yourself
Bookmarklet for running axe-core tests directly in the Browser

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Build BAAT with `npm run build`

The primary color of the application is controlled by the following environment variables:

- `THEME_PRIMARY` (default: `#d32228`)
- `THEME_PRIMARY_LIGHT` (default: `#7e1317`)
- `THEME_PRIMARY_DARK` (default: `#ed4047`)

## Creating a new Rule
BAAT allows you to run custom versions of axe-core. This way you can add your own rules to the test.
To do so, you need to create a fork of the [axe-core repository]](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) and [add your own rules](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/rule-development.md).
After running `npm run build` in the root repository of the root folder of axe-core, you will find a file called `axe.min.js` in the root folder. T
his file contains your custom rules and can be used with BAAT.
